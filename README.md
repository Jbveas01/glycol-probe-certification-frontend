# Kroger Technology Glycol Probe Front End

Front end part of the full stack application designed for Kroger Technology's Glycol Probe Certification Program.
This application stores probe data, updates probe data, displays relevant stats, and displays probes that need to be recertified. This repository contains only the front end of the full application. The server was developed in a separate repository which also contains the full stack application. This is located at [Glycol Probe Full Application](https://github.com/Jbveas01/glycolserver).

The full application is also hosted on Heroku found here: [Glycol Probe Application](https://ancient-hollows-84500.herokuapp.com/)
